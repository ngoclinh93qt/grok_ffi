.PP
For custom MCT, \f[C]-m\f[R] option has to be used (see below).

three components or more, otherwise no conversion.
.PP
\f[C]-m, -CustomMCT [file]\f[R]
.PP
Use custom array-based MCT of 32 bit signed values, comma separated,
line-by-line no specific separators between lines, no space allowed
between values.

equal to 2.
.PP
\f[C]-Q, -CaptureRes [capture resolution X,capture resolution Y]\f[R]
.PP
Capture resolution in pixels/metre, in double precision.

If the \f[C]-Q\f[R] command line parameter is set, then it will override
the resolution stored in the input image, if present
.IP \[bu] 2
The special values \f[C][0,0]\f[R] for \f[C]-Q\f[R] will force the
encoder to \f[B]not\f[R] store capture resolution, even if present in
input image.
.PP
\f[C]-D, -DisplayRes [display resolution X,display resolution Y]\f[R]

encoder to set the display resolution equal to the capture resolution.
.PP
\f[C]-C, -Comment [comment]\f[R]
.PP
Add \f[C]<comment>\f[R] in comment marker segment(s).
Multiple comments (up to a total of 256) can be specified, separated by
the \f[C]|\f[R] character.
For example:
\f[C]-C \[dq]This is my first comment|This is my second\f[R] will store
\f[C]This is my first comment\f[R] in the first comment marker segment,
and \f[C]This is my second\f[R] in a second comment marker.
.PP

.PP
\f[C]-G, -DeviceId [device ID]\f[R]
.PP
For Grok plugin running on multi-GPU system.
Specifies which single GPU accelerator to run codec on.
If the flag is set to -1, all GPUs are used in round-robin scheduling.
